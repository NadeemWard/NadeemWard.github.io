### Talks

[Several lectures and tutorials given while helping teach an intro to Reinforcement Learning course at McGill for the Master of Managemement in Analytics program.](https://github.com/NadeemWard/Intro-RL-course-tutorials)

[Intro to Python for Machine Learning tutorial given at McGill](https://github.com/NadeemWard/Intro-RL-course-tutorials/blob/master/Tutorial1/Tutorial%201-Intro%20to%20Python.ipynb)

### Other Projects

[Reimplementing simple policy gradient methods like REINFORCE and one-step Actor-Critic on OpenAI gym environments](https://github.com/NadeemWard/pytorch_simple_policy_gradients)

[Created a flexible GridWorld environment in python to run tabular Reinforcement Learning algorithms such as Dynamic programming, Tabular Temporal Differencing (TD) and Monte Carlo methods.](https://github.com/NadeemWard/GridWorld)

[In class Kaggle competition to classify the largest digit within an image with multiple digits. This work was done with Daoud Piracha.](https://github.com/NadeemWard/largest-digit-classification)
